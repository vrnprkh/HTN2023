const mainPrompt = 'I will first give multiple chunks of code, separated by a "[name]" where name is the name of the code file. I want you to ONLY return a list of explanations for the code. Each explanation should be split up into understandable parts where reasonable. Each explanation should be formatted as such "(n:m) explanation" where n and m are the start and end lines respectively. The explanations should be smart and explain the context of the code, and what the high level concepts behind the code are. Only return an explanation when prompted by "return name" where name is the file specified.'
